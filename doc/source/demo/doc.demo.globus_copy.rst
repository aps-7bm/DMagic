Tasks
+++++

- Data Copying and Sharing

    globus_copy copies a folder from a `Globus Connect Personal endpoint <https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal/>`__ to a Globus remote server and, optionally, sends an invitation e-mail (drop-dox style) to the user to access the remote folder. Since what is shared is a link to the folder, users will have access to the current and any future content.
