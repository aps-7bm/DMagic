About DMagic 
============

Data collection at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) can generate massive 
amount of data and often the beamline staff can be overwhelmed by 
routine data management tasks like sharing, distributing and archiving.

`DMagic <https://github.com/xray-imaging/DMagic>`_ aims to provide easy command-like
interface to the `APS scheduling system <https://schedule.aps.anl.gov/>`_

Basic functionalities include the ability, for a given experiment date, to retrieve the users' 
email addresses from the APS scheduling as well as experiment information.

`DMagic <https://github.com/xray-imaging/DMagic>`_ is written to support 
`DTagging <https://github.com/xray-imaging/DTagging>`_ and `Globus <https://github.com/xray-imaging/Globus>`_
