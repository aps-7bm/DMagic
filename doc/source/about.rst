email addresses from the APS scheduling as well as experiment information.


`DMagic <https://github.com/xray-imaging/DMagic>`_ is written to support 
`DTagging <https://github.com/xray-imaging/DTagging>`_ and `Globus <https://github.com/xray-imaging/Globus>`_

`DMagic <https://github.com/xray-imaging/DMagic>`_, `DTagging <https://github.com/xray-imaging/DTagging>`_ and `Globus <https://github.com/xray-imaging/Globus>`_ are designed to help managing the massive amount of data generated at the
