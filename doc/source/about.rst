`DMagic <https://github.com/xray-imaging/DMagic>`_ aims to provide easy command-line
interface to the `APS scheduling system <https://schedule.aps.anl.gov/>`_

Basic functionalities include the ability, for the current experiment, to retrieve the users' 
email addresses from the APS scheduling as well as experiment information. This infomation can 
be printed ("show" option) or used to update EPICS PVs ("tag" option)


`DMagic <https://github.com/xray-imaging/DMagic>`_ supports `Globus <https://github.com/xray-imaging/Globus>`_
a tool to automatically create Globus shared folders with users.

`DMagic <https://github.com/xray-imaging/DMagic>`_  and `Globus <https://github.com/xray-imaging/Globus>`_ are designed 
to help managing the massive amount of data generated at the `Advanced Photon Source <http://www.aps.anl.gov>`_ by providing 
an automatic way to tag, share, notify and distribute data to users.
